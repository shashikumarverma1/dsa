Modulating the array
MODULATING THE ARRAY



Problem Statement



Amy has an array A, of N integers. She also has an integer K, such that 0 <= K <= MIN (A1, A2, …, AN). Here MIN denotes the Minimum of the array.

She wants to “modulate” the array with positive integer M. “Modulating” an array with M, for each i between 1 to N, she converts Ai = (Ai – K) % M.

For example, if N = 3, K = 1 and A = [ 2, 5, 3] then after modulating the array with M = 2 it becomes A = [ 1, 0, 0].

She was given Q queries. In each query she has index of the array A, X and Y (1<=X, Y<=N, X may be equal to Y) and is ask to find how many positive values of M exists such that after modulating the array with M, AX becomes equal to AY. If infinite such values of M exists print -1.

Since she is busy in her job interview, she asks you to help her answer the queries.



NOTE: Queries are independent of each other.



Constraints



1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai <= 109
0 <= K <= MIN (A1, A2, …, AN)

Problem Statement



Antonio and his girlfriend decided to move their relationship to the next level and bought an array from a nearby arrays shop(name of the shop). As you may have already guessed, both of them are programmers.

They define the value of an array as the number of unique elements it has. Like value of array [1,2,1,2,2,3] = 3 as it has 3 unique elements(1,2 and 3), value of array [1,2,3,4] = 4 and so on.

After a few days, their relationship went through a tough phase and they decided to break up with each other. While breaking up they also decided to break up the bought array among themselves.

To break up the array, they decided to split the elements of the array among themselves such that the total value of the final arrays they receive is as maximum as possible.

For this, they went to a nearby relationship counselor(you). Given the array, Antonio and his girlfriend bought, print the maximum possible total value of the final arrays they can achieve if they divide the elements of the bought array optimally.

Note :

It may be possible that one of them does not receive any element of the bought array.


Input Format



First line contains a single integer denoting N.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the bought array.


Output Format



Print the maximum possible total value of the final arrays Antonio and his girlfriend can achieve if they divide the elements of the bought array optimally.

Explanation of Sample 1



They can divide the array elements as :

Antonio receives the 1st, 4th and 5th elements of the array.
His girlfriend receives rest of the elements i.e. 2nd, 3rd, and 6th.
Value of array Antonio receives = value of array [1,2,2] = 2

Value of array his girlfriend receives = value of array [2,1,3] = 3

Hence total value = 2+3 = 5. It can be proved that this is the maximum possible value.

COOL EVALUATION





Antonio has an array A consisting of N integers.

An array B is a prefix of array A if B can be formed by deleting several(possibly zero but not all) elements from the end of array A. Like for array A = [5,1,4,2], the prefixes are A1..1 = [5], A1..2 = [5,1], A1..3 = [5,1,4], A1..4 = [5,1,4,2].

A prefix is considered good if the sum of its elements is an odd number. Like for A = [5,1,4,2], A1..1 and A1..4 are the good prefixes.

Now, Antonio wants to rearrange the elements of array A such that there are a maximum number of good prefixes in final array A.

Given array A, print the maximum number of good prefixes Antonio can get in final array A.

Input Format

First line c+ontains a single integer denoting N.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A.
Output Format

Explanation of Sample 1

Rearrange the elements of array A as [3,4,6]

Sum of elements in prefix A1..1 = 3

Sum of elements in prefix A1..2 = 3+4 = 7

Sum of elements in prefix A1..3 = 3+4+6 = 13

Hence it is possible to rearrange the elements of the given array such that all its three prefixes are good.

Modulating the array
MODULATING THE ARRAY



Problem Statement



Amy has an array A, of N integers. She also has an integer K, such that 0 <= K <= MIN (A1, A2, …, AN). Here MIN denotes the Minimum of the array.

She wants to “modulate” the array with positive integer M. “Modulating” an array with M, for each i between 1 to N, she converts Ai = (Ai – K) % M.

For example, if N = 3, K = 1 and A = [ 2, 5, 3] then after modulating the array with M = 2 it becomes A = [ 1, 0, 0].

She was given Q queries. In each query she has index of the array A, X and Y (1<=X, Y<=N, X may be equal to Y) and is ask to find how many positive values of M exists such that after modulating the array with M, AX becomes equal to AY. If infinite such values of M exists print -1.

Since she is busy in her job interview, she asks you to help her answer the queries.

NOTE: Queries are independent of each other.

Problem Statement



There are N minions standing in a line. There is also a string S of length N-1 consisting only of ‘<’ and ‘>’ characters.

If the ith character (for each 1<=i<N) of string S is ‘>’, this means the ith minion is superior to the (i+1)th minions, and (i+1)th minion is inferior to the ith minion.

Whereas if the ith character (for each 1<=i<N) of string S is ‘<’, this means the ith minion is inferior to the (i+1)th minion and (i+1)th minion is superior to the ith minion.

Now you have got the job of distributing candies to the minions. Each minion must get atleast one candy and If a superior minion does not get strictly more candies than an inferior minion then the superior will beat the inferior minion to death. You don’t want this to happen and hence want to distribute the candies such that :

Each minion gets atleast one candy.
A superior minion gets strictly more candies than an inferior minion.
To accomplish this task you went to the candy shop to buy candies. Print the minimum number of candies you need to buy to accomplish the task.
